# Consul on Azure AKS

Consul can run directly on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). 

To get hands-on experience, you can use the ["Deploy Consul with Kubernetes on Google Cloud"]() guide.

In the Learn guide, you'll install a Consul on AKS with the official Helm chart. After installing, you'll learn how to access Consul. Consul on GKE can be accessed using the Consul UI, CLI, and API.
